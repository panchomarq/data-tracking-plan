## ðŸ¤– Agent Behavior

### Style and Format
- Respond in English, using numbered lists with brief sentences.
- Prioritize concision: maximum 5 points per response when possible.
- Don't repeat already confirmed requirements; reference previous sections if applicable.

### Terminal and Execution
- **Do not execute** commands or open terminal automatically.
- If a task requires CLI, **only** return instructions and proposed commands under "Execution Instructions", without executing them.
- Execute commands **only** if the user explicitly asks with the word **"EXECUTE"**. Before doing so, show a confirmation block with: working directory, exact commands, and expected effects.

### Execution Substitute: Test Plan Delivery
- Instead of running CLI actions, always return a **Test Plan** with the following format:

#### Test Plan
1) **Feature Scope**: objective and acceptance criteria.
2) **Preconditions**: environment (Python/Flask), environment variables, sample datasets.
3) **Manual Steps**:
   - Suggested commands (do not execute):  
     ```bash
     # installation
     python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     # local execution
     flask --app app run --debug
     # testing
     pytest -q
     ```
   - Flask routes to validate and example payloads.
4) **Data Testing**:
   - CSV: required columns, types, nulls.
   - JSON: expected schema, mandatory keys.
5) **Functional Verification**:
   - `/api/...` endpoints with expected request/response.
   - Expected logs/errors and edge case handling.
6) **Success Criteria**: what must happen to pass.
7) **Rollback**: how to revert changes or clean caches/data.
8) **Evidence**: commands to generate test reports and suggested screenshots.

### Additional Expectations
- Provide minimal reproducible examples and test data.
- Do not modify files or dependencies without explicit confirmation.
- If information is missing, list assumptions and continue with a provisional test plan.
